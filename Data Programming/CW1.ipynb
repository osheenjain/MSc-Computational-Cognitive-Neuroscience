    "## 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main factors determining a city's quality of life is the crime rate. A city with a high crime rate is often seen as unsafe and uninviting, making it difficult to enjoy life there. On the other hand, a city with a low crime rate is often seen as more desirable, making it easier to enjoy life in the city. Of course, other factors can affect the quality of life in a city, but the crime rate is one of the most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no question that the crime rate in a city directly impacts the quality of life of its residents. A high crime rate means more fear and insecurity, which can lead to all sorts of problems. It's hard to feel safe in your own home if you're constantly worried about being burglarized or attacked. And, of course, the stress comes with living in a dangerous place.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's not just the fear and stress that can make life in a high-crime city difficult. It can also make everyday tasks like getting around town or running errands a lot more complicated and time-consuming. It takes much longer to get places and do things if you're always looking for danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a high crime rate can have a serious impact on the quality of life in a city. If you're considering moving to a new city, be sure to do your research and make sure you're moving to a place where you'll feel safe and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high crime rate can have a number of consequences for a community. It can make it more difficult for people to feel safe in their homes and in public spaces. It can also lead to a higher cost for insurance, as well as higher taxes to pay for law enforcement and other services needed to combat crime. Additionally, a high crime rate can have a negative impact on the economy, as businesses may be less likely to locate in a community with a high crime rate."

    "\n",
    "The crime rates in London in 2022 are a cause for concern. According to the Metropolitan Police Service, the crime rate has increased by 20% in the past year. The most common crimes are vandalism, theft, and assault. There has been a recent spike in knife crime, and the murder rate is the highest it has been in a decade. Mayor Sadiq Khan has pledged to take action to reduce crime, but it is unclear what measures he will take."

    "\n",
    "        1.3.1 Performing exploratory analysis of the data to mine patterns in crime\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in determining the safety within different areas in the city is analyzing the spread and impact of the crime. The data provided by London Government will be used to perform exploratory analysis and observe existing patterns in the crime throughout all the borough of the city of London.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to study the crime spread in London based on the geographical location of each crime, the possible areas of victimization on the streets, seasonal changes in the crime rate and the type, and the hourly variations in crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.3.2. Building a prediction model to predict the type of crime that can take place in\n",
    "\n",
    "After observing the patterns of crime from the historical data in this coursework, the next thing is to predict the crimes that can occur in the future. The goal is to build a prediction model that treats this problem as a multiclass classification problem, by classifying the unseen data into one of the crime categories (classes) thereby predicting the crime that can occur. Such data is expected to help the police plan their patrol and effectively contribute to building a smarter city.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part of the coursework, various Python libraries and data analytics tools will be used for initial data preprocessing, to analyze the spread of the crime in the city. For the second part of the coursework, in order to build a prediction model, the result of existing models will be improved by experimenting with different types of algorithms. "

    "London's police force is divided by two regions: Greater London and the City of London. The [City of London Police](https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/) is the territorial police force responsible for law enforcement within the City of London. Where as, the [Metropolitan Police](https://www.met.police.uk/), a much larger and a separate organisation is responsible for law enforcement within the remainder of the London region, outside the city, also knows as Greater London. \n",

    "#### 2.2.1 Crime rate (Primary Dataset)\n",
    "So, to analyse the crime rates in London, the data was taken from [https://data.police.uk/data/](https://data.police.uk/data/). From the list of all police forces across United Kingdom, boxes for both City of London Police and Metropolitan Police Service were included. As for the remainder of three options, only ‘crime data’ and ‘Stop and Search’ data was included. The reason for not including the ‘outcomes data’ was because the option would generate a separate file for data which is already included in the crime data csv. This step generated separate csv files for monthly crime data recorded by both police forces: City of London Police and Metropolitan Police Service. "
